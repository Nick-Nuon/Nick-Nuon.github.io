            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>For the past year and a half, I've worked alongside Daniel Lemire on three projects:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding <a href="https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf/releases/tag/v4.0.0">Latin1 support to simdutf</a>(up to 38 times faster than the ICU library)</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/simdutf/SimdUnicode">SimdUnicode</a>: Porting simdutf's UTF8 validation routines to C# (up to 2.3x times faster than the equivalent .NET 9 SIMD-accelerated counterpart, currently under consideration for adoption into .NET. Further <a href="https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/nightly/stdlib/src/utils/_utf8_validation.mojo">ported to mojo</a> by Chris Lattner's team )</li>
                <img src="img/SIMDUnicode_results.png" alt="">
                <li><a rel="stylesheet" href="https://github.com/simdutf/SimdBase64">SimdBase64</a>: Porting simdutf's Base64 validation routines to C# (up to 10 times faster than its .NET runtime SIMD-accelerated counterpart, currently <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/107816">slated for adoption</a> into .NET 10)</li>
                <img src="img/SIMDBase64_results.png" alt="">
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>This website has a few goals:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> To document how I was able to contribute to the above projects. 
                </li>
                <li>To serve as a tutorial, of sort.
                    I  prefer shorter articles with an overarching narrative: they tend to stick a lot easier.
                    It ended up being a series of vignettes and lessons learned rather than a tutorial but this is how I did it. 
                </li>
                <li>To serve as a portfolio for job search purposes.This site will serve as a summary of major milestones but also as <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a> repository of expository essays. 
                </li>
                <li>To serve as a set of notes I can refer back to as needed</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p></p>

            <br>
            <p><em>Please note this is a draft and a work in progress: all mistakes are my own.</em></p>
